<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

<h4>The Texas Risk Reduction Program developed guidance for managing LNAPL in the subsurface and provided a quantitative screening tool for knowing when LNAPL is potentially recoverable using total fluids submersible pumps. This tool was developed by entering certain site conditions into the numerical multiphase transport model ARMOS. Key assumptions included: petroleum hydrocarbon contamination and a single submersible total-fluids recovery pump with an inlet set at depth of 3 feet (1 metre) below static water level. The figure to the right summarizes the results of numerous model simulations configured for different fuel viscosities, hydraulic conductivities, product thicknesses, and recovery system drawdown that are combined with assumptions of what constitutes recovery effectiveness at this site. <br><br>

This tool provides an approximate indicator of recoverability based on the new LNAPL paradigm that soil type and the LNAPL vertical equilibrium model are key recoverability factors.  The Texas Risk Reduction Program described this curve as an example quantitative screen for conventional NAPL recovery and recommended it not be used on a site-specific basis.  However, several members of the original TRRP guidance did feel it could provide a rapid planning level method to evaluate recoverability, and therefore this tool is used as a Tier 1 tool for the Concawe toolbox.  For a more detailed evaluation of recoverability, use the Multi-Site LNAPL Volume and Extent Model (How Much LNAPL is Present, Tier 2) or use the LNAPL transmissivity calculator (Will LNAPL recovery be effective, Tier 2).

<h4>Divide the apparent thickness (measured thickness) in the monitoring well of interest by this Ratio to get a soil type adjusted estimate for True Thickness (“specific volume”).</h4>
